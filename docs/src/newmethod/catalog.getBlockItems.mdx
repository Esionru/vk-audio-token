# catalog.getBlockItems

Get items in a block. A block is a part of the section.

Parameters:

|Name|Value|

Block ids are returned in `id` or `block_id` fields. 
They are returned, for example, by catalog.getSection method. 

Offset is returned in the `next_from` field and is needed, for example, for scrolling suggested artists right
(getting more artist icons)
